<p><strong>What information we collect in our apps</strong><br/>
We receive some information automatically when you use our Apps. This includes data about your device, software, operating system, the language you've set for your Device, advertising IDs for advertisement tracking (“Advertising IDs”) and your IP address.<br/>
We do not collect personally identifiable information about you or your children through our apps. In other words, we do not collect information such as your name, address, phone number or email address.<br/>
Occasionally we collect the personal information that you voluntarily provide to us (e.g. email addresses you give us when you submit a request to a support via our web or email).<br/>
When you make in-app purchases in the our apps, we do not collect or have any access to your name and billing information. This information is collected and stored by your platform (e.g. Android's Google Play) or your platform's payment processor.<br/>
</p>




<p><strong>How we use this information collected in our apps</strong><br/>
We collect this Information to improve performance and reliability of our apps and to get a better understanding of what users in general prefer. We do not link any of this Information in any way to individuals or any other information we might obtain. We do not share, sell or in any other way give other persons or companies. We don't rent or sell your email address.<br/><br/>
Our mobile applications comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). In the event that a user identifies himself/herself as a child under the age of 13 through a support request or feedback, we will not collect, store or use and will delete in a secure manner any personal information of such a user.<br/><br/>
Our apps might contain ads from Google Admob that may use some information of your devices (not including your name, address, email address, telephone number, etc) to provide appropriate advertisements. We take care of filtering categories of sensitive and unsuitable ads for children. But rarely can an advertiser misclassify your ads, and this situation is beyond our reach.
